Description
    - what
    - why
    - how

    - This website was created to serve as a quick reference for the weather and forecast in specific locations..

    - It is meant to be a quick way of determining the current weather and five-day forecast at a given location when searched by the user.

    - This website was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and JQuery formatting to provide ease-of-use and quick access.

    - This website solves the problem of not knowing the weather and forecast in an area.

    --- As per the assignment:

    -- The HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding has been built from scratch to form the elements of the website.

    - This was done using elements such as: functions, variables, for loops, intervals, if statements, DOM traversal, DOM manipulation, localstorage.getItem/localstorage.setItem, eventListeners, and fetch requests, API calls, JSON.stringify(), and JSON.parse().

    - A search button, input bar, and a clear button are provided for ease-of-use.

    - Once a valid location is searched, the current weather and five-day forecast are provided, as well as a button to make prior searches quicker.

    - Once an invalid location is searched, an alert box will appear stating that only valid locations can be searched.

    - Once the clear button is clicked, the other buttons of all prior searches are removed and the site is reloaded.

    This website was coded by Dylan Storm Johnson.
